FakeDRM - userspace DRM emulation library

This is FakeDRM, a userspace library providing userspace emulation of
Linux Direct Rendering Manager kernel interfaces. The library provides
wrappers for system calls (typically provided by libc) to catch relevant
operations on DRM devices and emulate them in userspace.

Compiling
---------

libdrm uses CMake as its build system of choice and follows the typical
procedures of installation for projects using this build system. The first
step is to create makefiles by running CMake:

	cmake .

Next step is to build the library:

	make

and once make finishes successfully, install the package using

	make install

Running
--------

FakeDRM library consists of a binary file called libfakedrm.so, which needs
to be preloaded for any application which should have kernel DRM interfaces
emulated in userspace:

	export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libfakedrm.so
	./testapp

To support various extensions provided by real kernel DRM drivers,
an environment variable FAKEDRM_DRIVER is used to select which driver
should be emulated. Currently supported drivers:

dummy		- dummy FakeDRM driver, providing only generic functionality
exynos		- Exynos DRM (Samsung SoC DRM),
